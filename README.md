# RustBound !! 

**The dataset and code are for research purpose only** 

Analysis of current methods of Function Boundary Detection in Stripped Binary Files on executable files generated from Rust source code

The main components of this repository are:
1. Ripkit : tool for cloning and compiling rust binaries
2. XDA : Implementation from "XDA: Accurate, Robust Disassembly with Transfer Learning" of a function boundary detector
3. ghidra_bench: tool for benchmarking ghidra

## Ripkit... 

*Ripkit* can:
1. Clone rust crates and compile them for various targets
2. Save produced Rust binaries in db 
3. Export rust datasets 
4. Profile such datasets
5. Use Ghidra, or IDA to analyze function boundary detection in datasets

See the README.md file in the `ripkit` directory for ripkit installation and setup. 

## Training BiRNN...

*Input:* The BiRNN requires ".npy" files for training. These can be generated using the command:
```bash
cli.py gen-npzs
```
This will extract the .text section of the provided binaires and generate feature vectors for the model.


*Training:* Use the command:
```bash
cli.py train-on
```

*Testing:* Use the command:
```bash
cli.py test-on-nongpu
```

## Training XDA... 
There are some preprocesing steps that are best exapline dby XDA's
github repo. 

Once those are done, the cli tool ryan_cli.py is what I used to 
help me train test and log expirements


## Running IDA / Ghidra

Ripkit has just one function to support extracting function bounds from a file uploaded to IDA. Look at the command for ripkit 'ida':
```bash
python ripkit/main.py ida
```
Similarly ghidra is supported as well:
```bash
python ripkit/main ghidra
```
